# Credit Card Validator (Luhn Algorithm)

This project provides a simple Python script to validate credit card numbers using the [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm).

## How it Works

The Luhn algorithm is a checksum formula used to validate various identification numbers, especially credit card numbers. The script checks if a given card number is valid according to this algorithm.

## Usage

1. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python validate_credit_card.py
    ```
2. Enter the credit card number when prompted (spaces and dashes are allowed).
3. The script will print whether the number is valid or not.

## Example

```
Enter credit card number: 4539 1488 0343 6467
Valid credit card number.
```
